    "# Connect Four with Minimax AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with developing an AI for the classic **Connect Four** game, where two players alternate dropping pieces into a 6x7 grid. The goal is to get four consecutive pieces in a row, column, or diagonal. Your AI should use the **minimax algorithm** to determine the best moves **without implementing alpha-beta pruning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Game Setup**: Implement a 6x7 grid for the Connect Four board. Each cell should either be empty or contain a piece from one of the two players (Player and AI).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Piece Dropping**: Implement a function to drop a piece in the lowest available row within a chosen column. If the column is full, the move should be considered invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Winning Condition**: Develop a function to check if a player has won by getting four consecutive pieces in any row, column, or diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Minimax Algorithm**:\n",
    "   - Implement the **minimax algorithm** to evaluate all possible moves up to a given depth (e.g., 4).\n",
    "   - The AI should aim to maximize its chances of winning while minimizing the player’s opportunities to win.\n",
    "   - If a terminal state (win, loss, or draw) is reached at a particular depth, the algorithm should evaluate the board accordingly.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Game Flow**:\n",
    "   - The game should allow the player and AI to take alternate turns until one wins or the board is full (draw).\n",
    "   - The player should be able to input a column to place their piece.\n",
    "   - The AI should automatically choose a column based on the minimax evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Display**: After each move, display the current board state to show piece placements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement the Connect Four game such that the AI uses the **minimax algorithm** to optimally decide its moves. The AI should play against the player and aim to win or force a draw by minimizing the player’s winning chances.\n"
